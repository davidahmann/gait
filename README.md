# Gait — Run Durable Agent Jobs, Capture Tool Calls, Prove What Happened

Agents are capable enough to execute real work. The limiting factor is not intelligence — it is control, proof, and reproducibility. Long-running work fails mid-flight with no recovery. State-changing tool calls are impossible to reconstruct. Post-hoc logs are not dispute-grade evidence.

Gait is an offline-first Go CLI that fixes this. Dispatch durable jobs with checkpointed state. Capture every tool call as a signed pack. Verify, diff, and replay offline. Turn incidents into deterministic CI regressions. Gate high-risk actions before side effects execute.

## In Plain Language

Use Gait when an AI agent can cause real side effects and you need deterministic control plus portable proof.

Incident-to-surface mapping:

- Agent triggers a destructive action you cannot justify later -> `gait gate eval` + signed trace + fail-closed non-execute.
- Agent run fails and cannot be reproduced -> `gait run record`/`gait pack build` + `gait regress bootstrap`.
- Long-running work crashes midway and state is unclear -> `gait job submit|checkpoint|inspect` + job pack verification.

## When To Use Gait

- Tool-calling AI agents need enforceable allow/block/approval decisions.
- You need signed, portable evidence artifacts for PRs, incidents, or audits.
- You want offline, deterministic regressions that fail CI with stable exit behavior.
- You run multi-step jobs and need checkpoints, pause/resume/cancel, and inspectable state.

## When Not To Use Gait

- No local Gait CLI or Gait artifacts are available in the execution path.
- Your workflow only needs prompt orchestration without tool-side effects or evidence contracts.
- You only need hosted observability dashboards and do not need offline verification or deterministic replay.

**For platform and AI engineering teams** — run multi-step, multi-hour agent jobs without losing work, state, or provenance.

**For security engineers and production owners** — every high-risk tool call passes a deterministic policy decision with portable, independently verifiable proof.

## Try It (Offline, <60s)

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidahmann/gait/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Create a signed pack from a synthetic agent run
gait demo

# Prove it's intact
gait verify run_demo

# Turn it into a CI regression gate — one command
gait regress bootstrap --from run_demo --junit ./gait-out/junit.xml
```

No account. No API key. No internet. You now have a verified artifact and a permanent regression test.

## Simple End-To-End Scenario

Run the canonical wrapper path in `examples/integrations/openai_agents/quickstart.py` to see allow/block/require-approval outcomes at the tool boundary.

## Fast 20-Second Proof

Use the short demo assets in `docs/assets/gait_demo_20s.*` for a quick artifact-and-verify walkthrough.

## What You Get

**Durable jobs** — dispatch long-running agent work that survives failures. Checkpoints, pause/resume/cancel, approval gates, deterministic stop reasons. No more lost state at step 47.

**Signed packs** — every run and job emits a tamper-evident artifact (Ed25519 + SHA-256 manifest). Verify offline. Attach to PRs, incidents, audits. One artifact is the entire proof.

**Incident → CI gate in one command** — `gait regress bootstrap` converts a bad run into a permanent regression fixture with JUnit output. Exit 0 = pass, exit 5 = drift. Never debug the same failure twice.

**Fail-closed policy enforcement** — `gait gate eval` evaluates a structured tool-call intent against YAML policy before the side effect runs. Non-allow means non-execute. Signed trace proves the decision.

**Deterministic replay and diff** — replay an agent run using recorded results as stubs (no real API calls). Diff two packs to see what changed, including context drift classification.

**Voice agent gating** — gate high-stakes spoken commitments (refunds, quotes, eligibility) before they're uttered. Signed `SayToken` capability + callpack artifacts for voice boundaries.

**Risk ranking** — rank highest-risk actions across runs and traces by tool class and blast radius. Offline, no dashboard.

## One-Command Workflows

```bash
# Block a destructive tool call
gait gate eval --policy examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml \
  --intent examples/policy/intents/intent_delete.json --json

# Rank top risks across all your runs
gait report top --runs ./gait-out --traces ./gait-out --limit 5

# Dispatch a durable job with checkpoint
gait job submit --id job_1 --json
gait job checkpoint add --id job_1 --summary "step complete" --json
gait pack build --type job --from job_1 --json

# Gate a voice commitment before it's spoken
gait voice token mint --intent commitment.json --policy policy.yaml --json
```

## Integrations

Gait enforces at the tool boundary, not the prompt boundary. Your dispatcher calls Gait; non-`allow` means non-execute.

Managed/preloaded agent note: if your platform does not expose a tool-call interception point, use observe/report/regress workflows; full fail-closed enforcement requires boundary interception.

Tool boundary (canonical definition):

- The exact call site where your runtime is about to execute a real tool side effect.
- The adapter serializes a structured intent (`IntentRequest`) and calls Gait (`gait gate eval` or `gait mcp serve`).
- Enforcement rule is strict: if verdict is not `allow`, do not execute the tool.

```python
def dispatch_tool(tool_call):
    decision = gait_evaluate(tool_call)
    if decision["verdict"] != "allow":
        return {"executed": False, "verdict": decision["verdict"]}
    return {"executed": True, "result": execute_real_tool(tool_call)}
```
