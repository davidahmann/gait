## Gait In 60s

Terminal speaks for itself: control + proof + regression in under a minute.

![Gait in 60 seconds terminal demo](docs/assets/gait_demo_60s.gif)

## The Problem

AI agents execute tool calls — database writes, API calls, file mutations — with real authority and real consequences. When something goes wrong, there is no artifact trail, no regression test, and no policy gate that can block the next one. Guardrails scan prompts. Gait decides whether the action runs, and signs the proof either way.

## Install And First Win (60 Seconds)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidahmann/gait/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Linux and macOS. Windows: see `docs/install.md`.
Homebrew (tap) alternative:

```bash
brew tap davidahmann/tap
brew install gait
```

Tap-first release details: `docs/homebrew.md`.

```bash
gait demo
```

```text
run_id=run_demo
bundle=./gait-out/runpack_run_demo.zip
ticket_footer=GAIT run_id=run_demo manifest=sha256:88913ed... verify="gait verify run_demo"
verify=ok
```

You now have a signed, portable execution artifact. Verify it:

```bash
gait verify run_demo
```

Paste the `ticket_footer` line into any incident ticket or PR. Anyone with the artifact can verify it offline.

## What Just Happened

- **runpack** = a signed ZIP of exactly what the agent did (intents, results, receipts, manifest with SHA-256 hashes)
- **verify** = offline integrity proof anyone can run, no network needed
- **ticket_footer** = the one line you paste into tickets so incidents are traceable

Full mental model: `docs/concepts/mental_model.md`

## Why Gait Exists

**What it does:** Gait sits at the tool-call boundary — the point where an agent exercises real authority. It decides `allow`, `block`, `require_approval`, or `dry_run` before side effects execute, and emits a signed trace for every decision. Most runtime governance tools observe and alert after the fact. Gait decides before the action runs and proves what happened.

**What it is:**

- an execution-boundary guard for production agent tool calls
- a verifiable artifact standard (runpack + trace) for incidents, CI, and audits
- a vendor-neutral CLI that works across frameworks and model providers

**What it is not:**

- not a hosted dashboard
- not prompt-only filtering
- not a replacement for your identity provider, SIEM, or ticketing system

**Works with your existing stack:**

- identity and vault systems (CyberArk, HashiCorp Vault, cloud IAM)
- AI gateway/guardrail scanners for prompt and output inspection
- SIEM and observability (Splunk, Datadog, Elastic)

## Turn That Into A CI Regression (2 Minutes)

Fast path (one command):

```bash
gait regress bootstrap --from run_demo --json --junit ./gait-out/junit.xml
```

This incident is now a permanent test. If agent behavior drifts, CI fails.

Equivalent explicit path:

```bash
gait regress init --from run_demo --json
gait regress run --json --junit ./gait-out/junit.xml
```

What you get:

- `gait.yaml` and `fixtures/run_demo/runpack.zip`
- `regress_result.json`
- `junit.xml` for CI test reporting

Exit codes are stable and CI-friendly:

- `0` success
- `5` regression failed

When regress fails, JSON output includes `top_failure_reason`, `next_command`, and `artifact_paths` so you can act without parsing large files.

## Block Dangerous Tool Calls (5 Minutes)

Gate examples use fixture files from this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidahmann/gait.git && cd gait
```

Test policies deterministically (no side effects, no keys needed):

```bash
gait policy validate examples/policy/base_low_risk.yaml --json
gait policy fmt examples/policy/base_low_risk.yaml --write --json
gait policy test examples/policy/base_low_risk.yaml examples/policy/intents/intent_read.json --json
gait policy test examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml examples/policy/intents/intent_delete.json --json
gait policy simulate --baseline examples/policy/base_low_risk.yaml --policy examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml --fixtures examples/policy/intents --json
```

- low risk read -> `allow`
- high risk destructive call -> `block`

Evaluate a real intent through Gate:

```bash
gait gate eval \
  --policy examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml \
  --intent examples/policy/intents/intent_delete.json \
  --trace-out ./gait-out/trace_delete.json \
  --json
```

Every gate decision produces a signed `trace_<id>.json`. Every block is auditable.

Block a prompt-injection-style tool call:

```bash
gait policy test examples/prompt-injection/policy.yaml examples/prompt-injection/intent_injected.json --json
```

Result: `verdict: block`, `reason_codes: ["blocked_prompt_injection"]`, and `matched_rule` for fast rule-debug context.

Gate evaluates structured tool-call intent, not prompt text. If verdict is not `allow`, execution does not run.

## Where Enforcement Lives In Your Code

Gait does not automatically intercept tools. Your runtime must call Gait at the tool-dispatch chokepoint and enforce the verdict before any side effects execute.

Minimal insertion pattern:

```python
def dispatch_tool(tool_call):
    decision = gait_evaluate(tool_call)  # gate eval / mcp proxy / POST /v1/evaluate
    if decision["verdict"] != "allow":
        return {
            "executed": False,
            "verdict": decision["verdict"],
            "reason_codes": decision.get("reason_codes", []),
        }
    result = execute_real_tool(tool_call)
    return {"executed": True, "result": result}
```

If you run `gait mcp serve`, the service still returns a decision only. The caller must enforce non-`allow` outcomes as non-executable.

## Integrate With Your Framework

**OpenClaw** — install the official boundary package in one command:

```bash
bash scripts/install_openclaw_skill.sh
```

**Gas Town** — wire the worker hook to gate eval. Adapter and secure deployment guide:

- `examples/integrations/gastown`
- `docs/launch/secure_deployment_gastown.md`

**Other frameworks** — adapters ship for OpenAI Agents, LangChain, AutoGen, and AutoGPT:

- `examples/integrations/openai_agents`
- `examples/integrations/langchain`
- `examples/integrations/autogen`
- `examples/integrations/autogpt`
- `sdk/python/examples/openai_style_tool_decorator.py`
- `sdk/python/examples/langchain_style_tool_decorator.py`

Full integration walkthrough: `docs/integration_checklist.md`
Reduce repeated flags with a project config: `docs/project_defaults.md`

For long-running MCP interception instead of one-shot calls:

```bash
gait mcp serve --policy examples/policy-test/allow.yaml --listen 127.0.0.1:8787 --trace-dir ./gait-out/mcp-serve/traces
```

Transport endpoints from one service config:

- `POST /v1/evaluate` (JSON response)
- `POST /v1/evaluate/sse` (SSE response)
- `POST /v1/evaluate/stream` (NDJSON response)

## Production Posture (oss-prod Profile)

For fail-closed production enforcement, use `--profile oss-prod` with explicit keys and a credential broker:

```bash
gait gate eval \
  --policy examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml \
  --intent examples/policy/intents/intent_delete.json \
  --profile oss-prod \
  --key-mode prod \
  --private-key examples/scenarios/keys/approval_private.key \
  --credential-broker stub \
  --trace-out ./gait-out/trace_delete_prod.json \
  --json
```

The demo key in `examples/scenarios/keys/` is for walkthroughs only. In production, provision your own key and replace `stub` with `env` or `command` broker.

Generate and validate local signing keys:

```bash
gait keys init --out-dir ./gait-out/keys --prefix prod --json
gait keys verify --private-key ./gait-out/keys/prod_private.key --public-key ./gait-out/keys/prod_public.key --json
```

For staged rollout, simulate mode reports what *would have* happened without enforcing:

```bash
gait gate eval \
  --policy examples/policy/base_medium_risk.yaml \
  --intent examples/policy/intents/intent_write.json \
  --simulate --json
```

## Local Signal Engine

Cluster incident families and rank top issues offline:

```bash
gait scout signal --runs ./gait-out/runpack_run_demo.zip --json
```

If you also have regress results or traces, pass them for richer analysis:

```bash
gait scout signal --runs ./gait-out/runpack_run_demo.zip --regress ./gait-out/regress_result.json --traces ./gait-out/trace_delete.json --json
```

Output includes deterministic fingerprints, family grouping, ranked top issues with driver attribution (`policy_change`, `tool_result_shape_change`, `reference_set_change`, `configuration_change`), and bounded fix suggestions.

## Why Now

Agent frameworks are shipping tool-use to production faster than security tooling can keep up. OpenClaw's recent RCE advisory and Gas Town's worker-escape disclosure both trace back to unguarded tool-call boundaries — exactly the problem Gait is built to solve. If your agents call tools with real authority, the window between "works in staging" and "incident in production" is closing.

## Feedback

Something broken, confusing, or wrong? Open an issue or start a discussion. Gait is pre-1.1 and the fastest way to improve it is honest feedback from people trying to use it.

- Issues: [https://github.com/davidahmann/gait/issues](https://github.com/davidahmann/gait/issues)
- `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reports
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

## OSS and Enterprise

- OSS v1 is the free execution substrate: runpack, regress, gate, doctor, scout, and adapter kits.
- Enterprise is a separate control-plane layer for fleet governance, consuming OSS artifacts.
- Artifact contracts remain stable regardless of enterprise adoption.
