# Gait

Gait is the offline-first CLI that makes production AI agents controllable and debuggable by default.

It gives teams a deterministic workflow from incident to proof:

- capture a verifiable run artifact (`runpack_<run_id>.zip`)
- replay and diff runs deterministically (stub replay by default)
- convert incidents into CI regressions
- enforce policy at the tool-call boundary with signed traces

The durable contract is artifacts, schemas, and exit codes. Not a hosted UI.

## Why Teams Adopt Gait

Production agent incidents usually fail on the same question: "What happened, exactly?"

Gait answers that with portable artifacts instead of screenshots and guesswork:

- platform teams get repeatable incident reproduction and CI guardrails
- security teams get enforceable policy decisions and signed trace records
- compliance teams get verifiable evidence packs and stable outputs
- agent developers get a fast loop from bug report to deterministic regression

## Category Positioning

What Gait is:

- an artifact-first Agent Control Plane for production tool execution
- an execution-boundary guard (`gate`) plus verifiable receipts (`runpack`) plus deterministic regressions (`regress`)
- a vendor-neutral CLI contract that works across frameworks and model providers

What Gait is not:

- not a hosted governance dashboard
- not prompt-only filtering
- not a replacement for your identity provider, SIEM, or ticketing system

Why artifact-first + execution-boundary-first:

- tool calls are where authority is exercised, so control must happen there
- portable artifacts are the durable evidence contract across incidents, CI, and audits
- deterministic regressions turn one incident into a permanent safety test

## Start Here (Single Install Path)

Use one path for first use: install a release binary with checksum verification.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidahmann/gait/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Run the offline first-win loop:

```bash
gait doctor --json
gait demo
gait verify run_demo
gait regress bootstrap --from run_demo --json --junit ./gait-out/junit.xml
```

Install options, pinned versions, and source-build fallback are documented in `docs/install.md`.

Sample `gait demo` output:

```text
run_id=run_demo
bundle=./gait-out/runpack_run_demo.zip
ticket_footer=GAIT run_id=run_demo manifest=sha256:<digest> verify="gait verify run_demo"
verify=ok
```

## Paste Into Ticket: Receipt Semantics

The `ticket_footer` line is the shareable contract across incident tickets, PRs, and CI:

- `run_id`: stable handle for this run
- `manifest=sha256:<digest>`: immutable runpack manifest digest
- `verify="gait verify <run_id>"`: one-command integrity check

This is how teams move from "we think the agent did X" to "here is the exact verifiable artifact."

To regenerate a one-line footer from an existing artifact:

```bash
gait run receipt --from <run_id|path>
```

## Incident To Regression (Deterministic CI Path)

Fast path (one command):

```bash
gait regress bootstrap --from run_demo --json --junit ./gait-out/junit.xml
```

Equivalent explicit path:

```bash
gait regress init --from run_demo --json
gait regress run --json --junit ./gait-out/junit.xml
```

What you get:

- `gait.yaml`
- `fixtures/run_demo/runpack.zip`
- `regress_result.json`
- optional `junit.xml` for CI test reporting

Canonical CI path:

- `.github/workflows/adoption-regress-template.yml`
- `docs/ci_regress_kit.md`

Stable exit behavior is CI-friendly:

- `0` success
- `5` regression failed

When regress fails, output is actionable without opening large JSON first:

- `top_failure_reason`
- `next_command`
- `artifact_paths`

## Gate High-Risk Tools

Start with deterministic policy fixture tests:

```bash
gait policy test examples/policy/base_low_risk.yaml examples/policy/intents/intent_read.json --json
gait policy test examples/policy/base_medium_risk.yaml examples/policy/intents/intent_write.json --json
gait policy test examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml examples/policy/intents/intent_delete.json --json
```

Typical outcomes:

- low risk read -> `allow`
- medium risk write -> `require_approval`
- high risk destructive call -> `block`

Then evaluate real tool intents through Gate:

```bash
gait gate eval \
  --policy examples/policy/base_high_risk.yaml \
  --intent examples/policy/intents/intent_delete.json \
  --profile oss-prod \
  --credential-broker stub \
  --trace-out ./gait-out/trace_delete.json \
  --json
```

For staged rollout, use simulate mode first:

```bash
gait gate eval --policy examples/policy/base_medium_risk.yaml --intent examples/policy/intents/intent_write.json --simulate --json
```

## Why Gate Exists (Enterprise Security Boundary)

In production agent systems, instruction and data collide:

- external or retrieved content can carry tool-like instructions
- prompt-layer filtering alone does not reliably constrain tool execution
- governance must happen at the execution boundary, not in prompt text

Gate evaluates structured tool-call intent, not prompt text. If verdict is not `allow`, execution must not run.

Concrete blocked prompt-injection-style example:

```bash
gait policy test examples/prompt-injection/policy.yaml examples/prompt-injection/intent_injected.json --json
```

Expected result contains:

- `verdict: block`
- `reason_codes: ["blocked_prompt_injection"]`
- `violations: ["prompt_injection_egress_attempt"]`

## Local Signal Engine (Offline)

Cluster incident families and rank top issues locally, with no hosted dependency:

```bash
gait scout signal --runs ./gait-out/runpack_run_demo.zip --regress ./gait-out/regress_result.json --json
```

The report includes:

- deterministic `fingerprints` for incident-family clustering
- `families` with canonical run, count, and artifact pointers
- ranked `top_issues` with driver attribution (`policy_change`, `tool_result_shape_change`, `reference_set_change`, `configuration_change`)
- bounded fix suggestions with likely scope

## Runtime SLO and Fail-Closed Guarantees

v1.7 treats runtime overhead and safety posture as enforceable contracts, not best-effort goals.

- Latency budgets are enforced at p50/p95/p99 for Gate endpoint classes (`fs.*`, `proc.exec`, `net.*`).
- Error budgets are enforced with explicit `max_error_rate` per command.
- Protected execution remains fail-closed for invalid intent, unsafe high-risk profile config, and broker/verification failures.

Canonical check:

```bash
make bench-budgets
```

- `docs/slo/runtime_slo.md`

## Integration Model (No Bypass Rule)

The minimum safe integration pattern:

```text
agent runtime
  -> wrapper or sidecar boundary
    -> gait gate eval --policy ... --intent ... --json
      -> allow: execute tool once
      -> block / require_approval / dry_run / error: do not execute
```

Rules:

- expose wrapped tools only, never raw side-effecting executors
- keep policy logic in Go core, not Python wrappers
- fail closed when evaluation or validation fails

Canonical integration paths:

- Python wrapper: `sdk/python/gait/adapter.py`
- Non-Python sidecar: `examples/sidecar/gate_sidecar.py`
- Framework adapter examples: `examples/integrations/openai_agents`, `examples/integrations/langchain`, `examples/integrations/autogen`, `examples/integrations/openclaw`, `examples/integrations/autogpt`

Use `docs/integration_checklist.md` for the implementation checklist and conformance checks.

## Core Commands

```text
gait demo
gait verify <run_id|path> [--profile standard|strict]
gait run replay <run_id|path> [--real-tools --unsafe-real-tools --allow-tools ...]  # stub replay only
gait run diff <left> <right>
gait run receipt --from <run_id|path>
gait regress init --from <run_id|path>
gait regress bootstrap --from <run_id|path> [--junit junit.xml]
gait regress run [--junit junit.xml]
gait scout signal --runs <csv>
gait policy test <policy.yaml> <intent_fixture.json>
gait gate eval --policy <policy.yaml> --intent <intent.json>
gait approve --intent-digest <sha256> --policy-digest <sha256> --ttl <duration> --scope <csv> --approver <identity> --reason-code <code>
gait trace verify <trace.json>
gait doctor --json
```

All major commands support `--json`. Most support `--explain`.

Security posture tips:

- Use `gait verify --profile strict ...` (or `gait guard verify --profile strict ...`) to require signatures plus explicit verify keys.
- In `oss-prod`, high-risk allow/approval policy rules must require broker credentials and runtime eval must pass `--credential-broker`.

## Contracts You Can Build On

- Canonical primitive contract: `docs/contracts/primitive_contract.md`
- Determinism: verify, diff, and stub replay are deterministic for identical artifacts
- Offline-first: core workflows do not require network access
- Default-safe privacy: reference receipts by default, raw capture is explicit opt-in
- Fail-closed safety: high-risk paths block on policy/approval ambiguity
- Schema stability: versioned artifacts and stable machine-readable outputs
- Stable exit codes: exit code surface is treated as API contract

## v1.1 to v1.5 Progress

- `v1.1`: scout coverage and guard pack foundations
