# Gait Security and Safety

- Fail-closed by default for ambiguous high-risk policy outcomes.
- Out-of-band emergency stop preemption blocks post-stop dispatches and records signed proof events.
- Structured intent model for policy decisions (not free-form prompt filtering).
- Destructive paths support phase-aware plan/apply boundaries plus fail-closed destructive budgets.
- Deterministic and offline verification for all artifact types (runpacks, jobpacks, callpacks).
- Duplicate ZIP entry names fail verification rather than falling back to ambiguous first/last-wins behavior.
- Ed25519 signatures and SHA-256 manifest integrity in PackSpec v1.
- Signed traces and explicit reason codes for blocked actions.
- Approval tokens can carry bounded destructive scope (`max_targets`, `max_ops`); overruns fail closed.
- Approved-script registry entries are signature-verified and policy-digest bound; tampered or missing state fails closed in high-risk enforcement.
- SayToken capability tokens for voice agent commitment gating — gated speech cannot execute without a valid token.
- Context evidence envelopes with fail-closed enforcement when evidence is missing for high-risk actions; `gait gate eval` requires a verified `--context-envelope` input for context-required policies, and raw intent digest/mode/age claims are not sufficient on their own.
- Durable jobs with deterministic stop reasons and checkpoint integrity.
- No hosted service dependency required for core operation.
- MCP trust inputs remain local-file based and complementary to external scanners or registries; Gait enforces, it does not become the scanner.
- Duplicate normalized MCP trust identities invalidate the local snapshot and required high-risk trust paths fail closed.
