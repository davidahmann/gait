# Gait (Extended LLM Context)

Gait is an offline-first runtime for AI agents that enforces policy at the tool boundary and emits signed, verifiable evidence artifacts.

## What Gait Is

- Durable job runtime for long-running agent work.
- Policy enforcement boundary for tool calls (`allow|block|require_approval|dry_run`).
- Evidence system with PackSpec artifacts and deterministic verification.
- Incident-to-regression conversion path with stable CI exit codes.

## Core Surfaces

1. Jobs: `gait job submit|status|checkpoint|pause|approve|resume|cancel|inspect`
2. Packs: `gait pack build|verify|inspect|diff`
3. Gate: `gait gate eval`
4. Regress: `gait regress init|run|bootstrap`
5. Doctor: `gait doctor`

Extended first-class surfaces:

- Voice: `gait voice token mint|verify`, `gait voice pack build|verify|diff`
- Context evidence: envelope and context-set digest enforcement in gate/regress flows

Supporting surfaces:

- MCP: `gait mcp proxy|serve`
- Registry: `gait registry install|list|verify`
- Scout: `gait scout snapshot|diff|signal`

## Tool Boundary (Canonical)

The tool boundary is the exact call site where your runtime is about to execute a real tool side effect.

- Input crossing boundary: structured intent (`IntentRequest` shape).
- Decision surface: `gait gate eval` or `gait mcp serve`.
- Enforced rule: if verdict is not `allow`, do not execute the side effect.

## When To Use

- Agent tool calls can mutate external systems and must be policy-gated.
- Teams need signed evidence artifacts for incidents, PRs, or audits.
- Regressions must be deterministic and CI-enforced with stable exits.
- Long-running jobs need checkpoints and durable local state.

## When Not To Use

- No local Gait CLI/artifact path is available.
- Workflow has no tool side effects and no evidence/compliance requirements.
- Hosted observability alone is sufficient and offline verification is unnecessary.

## Stable Exit Codes

- `0` success
- `1` internal/runtime failure
- `2` verification failure
- `3` policy block
- `4` approval required
- `5` deterministic regress failure
- `6` invalid input/usage
- `7` missing dependency
- `8` unsafe operation blocked
