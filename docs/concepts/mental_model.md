# Gait Mental Model

Use this as the 5-minute bridge between `gait demo` and production integration.

## One Sentence Model

Gait makes agent tool calls controllable by turning execution into four deterministic primitives: capture (`runpack`), enforce (`gate`), regress (`regress`), and diagnose (`doctor`).

## What Each Primitive Does

- `runpack`: records a deterministic artifact (`runpack_<run_id>.zip`) with manifest, intents, results, and receipts.
- `gate`: evaluates one structured `IntentRequest` against policy and returns a deterministic verdict (`allow`, `block`, `dry_run`, `require_approval`) plus signed trace.
- `regress`: converts an incident runpack into repeatable CI checks and JUnit-compatible output.
- `doctor`: validates local environment and produces machine-readable fixes.

## End-To-End Runtime Flow

1. Agent runtime reaches a tool boundary (wrapper or sidecar).
2. Integration emits `IntentRequest` and calls `gait gate eval`.
3. `gate` returns verdict + trace.
4. Tool executes only when verdict is `allow`.
5. Incident or drift uses `runpack` + `regress` to become a deterministic test.

## Sync Versus Async

- Synchronous path:
  - `gait gate eval`
  - `gait demo`
  - `gait verify`
  - `gait regress run`
- Asynchronous/operational path:
  - CI workflows and nightly suites
  - optional adoption and operational logs

## Where State Lives

- Local artifacts: `./gait-out/`
- Optional runpack cache: `~/.gait/runpacks`
- Optional registry cache and pins: `~/.gait/registry`
- Deterministic contracts: JSON schemas under `schemas/v1/` and Go types under `core/schema/v1/`

## Failure Behavior (Default-Safe)

- Core workflows are offline-first.
- Non-`allow` gate verdicts do not execute side effects.
- High-risk `oss-prod` paths enforce fail-closed requirements.
- Artifact verification failures are explicit and machine-readable (`--json` with stable exit codes).

## What This Is Not

- Not an agent orchestrator.
- Not a hosted dashboard dependency.
- Not a prompt-only filter.
