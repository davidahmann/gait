# Contributing to Gait

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This repo is optimized for **determinism**, **offline-first** workflows, and **stable artifacts**.

## Quick start

1. Install toolchain versions from `.tool-versions`.
2. Run:
   - `make fmt`
   - `make lint`
   - `make test`
   - `make test-hardening`
   - `make test-hardening-acceptance`
   - `make test-adoption`
   - `make test-uat-local` (full local install-path UAT matrix; longer running)

## Pre-commit (optional local runner)

Use pre-commit as a local convenience runner:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Pre-push (required)

Enable the repo pre-push hook (authoritative path in this repo):

```
make hooks
```

This runs `make lint`, `make test`, and `make codeql` on every push.
`make lint` now enforces hook activation (`core.hooksPath=.githooks`) and prints remediation:

```
make hooks
```

`make codeql` requires the CodeQL CLI in your `PATH`.
Install guide: <https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/>.
Emergency bypass (not recommended for normal flow): `GAIT_SKIP_CODEQL=1 git push`.

## Repo hygiene guards

`make lint` also enforces:

- required planning docs under `product/` stay tracked in Git
- generated artifacts (for example `gait-out/*`, coverage files, local binaries) are not committed

If it fails, remove tracked generated files with `git rm --cached <path>` and re-run lint.

## Documentation alignment

Use `docs/README.md` as the documentation ownership map to avoid duplication and drift.

When changing docs:

- keep normative behavior in `docs/contracts/*`
- keep runnable onboarding in `README.md` concise and link runbooks
- keep architecture and flow diagrams in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/flows.md`

If a doc includes Mermaid diagrams, validate rendering before opening a PR:

```
npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli@11.9.0 -i <diagram.mmd> -o /tmp/diagram.svg
```

## Code quality

- Go: `gofmt`, `golangci-lint`, `go vet`, `gosec`, `govulncheck`
- Python: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`
- Coverage must be **>= 85%** for Go core and Python SDK.

## Adoption asset contribution paths

Use these paths to keep adapter, policy, and fixture contributions reviewable and deterministic.

Public ecosystem listing and contribution funnel:

- Discovery index: `docs/ecosystem/awesome.md`
- Contribution workflow: `docs/ecosystem/contribute.md`
- Index data contract: `docs/ecosystem/community_index.json`
- Validation command: `python3 scripts/validate_community_index.py`

Use the dedicated proposal templates when adding new ecosystem entries:

- Adapter proposal: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adapter.yml`
- Skill proposal: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill.yml`

## Adapter Neutrality Contract (Required)

Gait stays vendor-neutral only if every adapter follows the same execution contract.

Non-negotiable adapter rules:

- No privileged bypasses for any framework. Tool execution must pass through `gait gate eval`.
- No framework-specific policy semantics. Policy behavior is owned by Go core and shared across adapters.
- No adapter-specific weakening of fail-closed behavior on gate evaluation errors.
- No adapter with materially stronger capabilities than others without parity plan and tracking issue.

Acceptance bar for a new adapter under `examples/integrations/<adapter>/`:

- `README.md` with copy/paste `allow` and `block` commands.
- Runnable quickstart that emits normalized intent and evaluates with `gait gate eval`.
- Explicit fail-closed behavior (`executed=false`) when verdict is `block`, `require_approval`, `dry_run`, or evaluation fails.
- Deterministic local artifact paths under `gait-out/integrations/<adapter>/`.
- Included in `scripts/test_adoption_smoke.sh` before merge.

### Adapter examples (`examples/integrations/<adapter>/`)

Required in each adapter folder:

- Follow parity contract in `examples/integrations/README.md`.
- `README.md` with copy/paste commands and expected outputs.
- A runnable entrypoint (for example `quickstart.py`) that routes tool calls through `gait gate eval`.
- At least one allow and one block/approval example policy file.

Required behavior:

- Expose only wrapped tools to the agent runtime.
- Fail closed if gate evaluation cannot complete.
- Write traces/run artifacts to a deterministic local path.

Validation before opening PR:

```
go build -o ./gait ./cmd/gait
make lint
make test
```

### Policy packs (`examples/policy/`)

When adding or changing policy packs:

- Keep templates in `examples/policy/` and fixture intents in `examples/policy/intents/`.
- Document rationale and expected verdicts in `examples/policy/README.md`.
- Include explicit reason-code expectations for block/approval paths.

Validation before opening PR:

```
go build -o ./gait ./cmd/gait
bash scripts/policy_compliance_ci.sh
```

### Deterministic fixtures and scenarios (`examples/scenarios/`, `examples/*`)

When adding fixtures or scenario scripts:

- Keep artifacts offline-safe (no network, no secrets).
- Pin output paths and compare deterministic fields (exit code, verdict, reason codes, hashes).
- Include expected command outputs in the scenario `README.md`.

Validation before opening PR:

```
go build -o ./gait ./cmd/gait
bash examples/scenarios/incident_reproduction.sh
bash examples/scenarios/prompt_injection_block.sh
bash examples/scenarios/approval_flow.sh
```

## Troubleshooting lint/test environment

### `govulncheck` cannot reach `vuln.go.dev`

`govulncheck` requires network access to the Go vulnerability database.

- Verify outbound HTTPS and DNS resolution are allowed.
- In restricted corporate environments, configure a mirror with `GOVULNDB`.
- If module fetches are also blocked, verify `GOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB` policy settings.

Example:

```
GOVULNDB=https://vuln.go.dev \
go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest -mode=binary ./gait
```

### `uv run pytest` or `uv run ...` fails due cache/runtime constraints

If `uv` fails in restricted or sandboxed environments, point caches to the repo workspace and retry:

```
mkdir -p .cache/uv .cache/go-build
UV_CACHE_DIR=$PWD/.cache/uv \
GOCACHE=$PWD/.cache/go-build \
make test
```

If `uv` crashes, upgrade to a current version and retry:

```
uv self update
```

## Issues and PRs

- Use the provided issue templates.
- Keep PRs focused and include tests.
- Avoid adding network dependencies to core flows.
- Review hardening contracts for reliability-impacting changes: `docs/hardening/contracts.md`.
- Use `docs/hardening/release_checklist.md` for release-impacting changes.
- Use `docs/launch/README.md` and linked launch templates when proposing messaging/distribution updates.
- Record architecture-impacting decisions in `docs/adr/`.

### Issue routing

- Use GitHub Discussions for open-ended ideas or early product exploration.
- Convert accepted Discussion outcomes into tracked Issues before implementation.
- Use Issue forms for execution items (`bug`, `feature`, `question`).

### Bug report quality bar (artifact-first)

Good bug reports include:

- `gait --version`
- exact command used
- full `--json` output
- relevant deterministic artifact paths under `gait-out/*`
- reproducible steps and expected vs actual behavior

Avoid posting secrets or raw sensitive content. Redact values and keep the artifact path references.

### Triage SLA (best effort)

- New Issues: initial maintainer response target is within 3 business days.
- Reproducible `bug` reports with required artifacts: target classification in 5 business days.
- `feature` and `question` Issues: target triage decision or routing note in 7 business days.

## Triage and labels

Use these labels consistently:

- `bug`: defects or regressions
- `feature`: new behavior or enhancements
- `question`: usage or integration questions
- `docs`: documentation-only changes
- `security`: security-impacting changes
- `breaking`: incompatible CLI or schema changes
- `good first issue`: newcomer-friendly tasks
- `needs-triage`: default for new issues

Triage flow:

1. Apply `needs-triage` on new issues.
2. Confirm reproducibility or intent, then swap to `bug` or `feature`.
3. Add `security` or `breaking` where relevant.
4. Prioritize with milestone or project board if used.

## Versioning policy

- CLI versioning and artifact schema versioning are tracked independently.
- Within a major version, schema changes are backward-compatible.
- Breaking schema or CLI changes require a major bump.

## Homebrew tap release process (gated)

Homebrew tap publishing is active and remains release-gated.

Gate criteria:

- At least one full release cycle with stable install/verify commands and no breaking packaging changes.
- Release includes integrity assets (`checksums.txt`, `checksums.txt.sig`, `checksums.txt.intoto.jsonl`, `sbom.spdx.json`, `provenance.json`).
- Exit-code and schema contracts remain stable for downstream automation.

Formula update workflow:

1. Cut and publish a signed GitHub release tag (`vX.Y.Z`).
2. Render formula from release checksums:
   - `bash scripts/render_homebrew_formula.sh --repo davidahmann/gait --version vX.Y.Z --checksums dist/checksums.txt --out Formula/gait.rb`
3. Ensure repo secret `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` is configured with `contents: write` on `davidahmann/homebrew-tap`.
4. Tag push triggers release workflow job `publish-homebrew-tap` to update `Formula/gait.rb`.
5. Verify:
   - `brew update`
   - `brew tap davidahmann/tap`
   - `brew reinstall davidahmann/tap/gait`
   - `brew test davidahmann/tap/gait`
   - `gait demo --json`

Manual fallback:

- `bash scripts/publish_homebrew_tap.sh --version vX.Y.Z --source-repo davidahmann/gait --tap-repo davidahmann/homebrew-tap --formula gait --branch main`

Reference:

- `docs/homebrew.md`

Rollback process:

1. Revert formula in tap repo to last known good release.
2. Merge rollback PR with priority.
3. If needed, yank broken GitHub release or mark as superseded in release notes.
4. Open incident issue with root cause and required release hardening actions before next cut.
