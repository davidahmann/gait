# Contributing to Gait

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This repo is optimized for **determinism**, **offline-first** workflows, and **stable artifacts**.

## Quick start

1. Install toolchain versions from `.tool-versions`.
2. Run:
   - `make fmt`
   - `make lint`
   - `make test`
   - `make test-hardening`
   - `make test-adoption`

## Pre-commit

Install pre-commit and run:

```
pre-commit install
```

Then verify:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Pre-push (required)

Enable the repo pre-push hook:

```
make hooks
```

This runs `make lint` and `make test` on every push.
`make lint` now enforces hook activation (`core.hooksPath=.githooks`) and prints remediation:

```
make hooks
```

## Code quality

- Go: `gofmt`, `golangci-lint`, `go vet`, `gosec`, `govulncheck`
- Python: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`
- Coverage must be **>= 85%** for Go core and Python SDK.

## Adoption asset contribution paths

Use these paths to keep adapter, policy, and fixture contributions reviewable and deterministic.

### Adapter examples (`examples/integrations/<adapter>/`)

Required in each adapter folder:

- `README.md` with copy/paste commands and expected outputs.
- A runnable entrypoint (for example `quickstart.py`) that routes tool calls through `gait gate eval`.
- At least one allow and one block/approval example policy file.

Required behavior:

- Expose only wrapped tools to the agent runtime.
- Fail closed if gate evaluation cannot complete.
- Write traces/run artifacts to a deterministic local path.

Validation before opening PR:

```
go build -o ./gait ./cmd/gait
make lint
make test
```

### Policy packs (`examples/policy/`)

When adding or changing policy packs:

- Keep templates in `examples/policy/` and fixture intents in `examples/policy/intents/`.
- Document rationale and expected verdicts in `examples/policy/README.md`.
- Include explicit reason-code expectations for block/approval paths.

Validation before opening PR:

```
go build -o ./gait ./cmd/gait
bash scripts/policy_compliance_ci.sh
```

### Deterministic fixtures and scenarios (`examples/scenarios/`, `examples/*`)

When adding fixtures or scenario scripts:

- Keep artifacts offline-safe (no network, no secrets).
- Pin output paths and compare deterministic fields (exit code, verdict, reason codes, hashes).
- Include expected command outputs in the scenario `README.md`.

Validation before opening PR:

```
go build -o ./gait ./cmd/gait
bash examples/scenarios/incident_reproduction.sh
bash examples/scenarios/prompt_injection_block.sh
bash examples/scenarios/approval_flow.sh
```

## Troubleshooting lint/test environment

### `govulncheck` cannot reach `vuln.go.dev`

`govulncheck` requires network access to the Go vulnerability database.

- Verify outbound HTTPS and DNS resolution are allowed.
- In restricted corporate environments, configure a mirror with `GOVULNDB`.
- If module fetches are also blocked, verify `GOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB` policy settings.

Example:

```
GOVULNDB=https://vuln.go.dev \
go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest -mode=binary ./gait
```

### `uv run pytest` or `uv run ...` fails due cache/runtime constraints

If `uv` fails in restricted or sandboxed environments, point caches to the repo workspace and retry:

```
mkdir -p .cache/uv .cache/go-build
UV_CACHE_DIR=$PWD/.cache/uv \
GOCACHE=$PWD/.cache/go-build \
make test
```

If `uv` crashes, upgrade to a current version and retry:

```
uv self update
```

## Issues and PRs

- Use the provided issue templates.
- Keep PRs focused and include tests.
- Avoid adding network dependencies to core flows.
- Review hardening contracts for reliability-impacting changes: `docs/hardening/contracts.md`.
- Use `docs/hardening/release_checklist.md` for release-impacting changes.
- Record architecture-impacting decisions in `docs/adr/`.

## Triage and labels

Use these labels consistently:

- `bug`: defects or regressions
- `feature`: new behavior or enhancements
- `docs`: documentation-only changes
- `security`: security-impacting changes
- `breaking`: incompatible CLI or schema changes
- `good first issue`: newcomer-friendly tasks
- `needs-triage`: default for new issues

Triage flow:

1. Apply `needs-triage` on new issues.
2. Confirm reproducibility or intent, then swap to `bug` or `feature`.
3. Add `security` or `breaking` where relevant.
4. Prioritize with milestone or project board if used.

## Versioning policy

- CLI versioning and artifact schema versioning are tracked independently.
- Within a major version, schema changes are backward-compatible.
- Breaking schema or CLI changes require a major bump.

## Homebrew tap release process (gated)

Homebrew publishing is deferred until the v1 install and contract stability gate is met.

Gate criteria:

- At least one full release cycle with stable install/verify commands and no breaking packaging changes.
- Release includes integrity assets (`checksums.txt`, `checksums.txt.sig`, `checksums.txt.intoto.jsonl`, `sbom.spdx.json`, `provenance.json`).
- Exit-code and schema contracts remain stable for downstream automation.

Formula update workflow:

1. Cut and publish a signed GitHub release tag (`vX.Y.Z`).
2. Compute the release archive SHA256 used by Homebrew formula.
3. Update tap formula `url`, `sha256`, and `version`.
4. Open PR in tap repo and require CI pass on macOS.
5. Merge and verify:
   - `brew update`
   - `brew install <tap>/gait`
   - `gait --help`

Rollback process:

1. Revert formula in tap repo to last known good release.
2. Merge rollback PR with priority.
3. If needed, yank broken GitHub release or mark as superseded in release notes.
4. Open incident issue with root cause and required release hardening actions before next cut.
