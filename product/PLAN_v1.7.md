# PLAN v1.7: OSS Execution Wedge Expansion (Endpoint + Skills + SLO)

Date: 2026-02-09
Source of truth: `product/PRD.md`, `product/ROADMAP.md`, `product/PLAN_v1.md`, `product/PLAN_v1.6.md`, current codebase (`main`)
Scope: OSS execution path only. This plan extends v1.6 with endpoint-governance depth, skill supply-chain controls, and measurable runtime SLO proof.

This plan is execution-ready and gap-driven. Every story includes concrete tasks, repo paths, and acceptance criteria.

---

## v1.7 Objective

Complete the OSS wedge for production local-agent adoption by finishing three prerequisites before enterprise control plane build:

- endpoint action taxonomy + deterministic policy enforcement
- skill provenance and signed/pinned execution safety
- hard runtime SLO proof for gate overhead and fail-closed behavior

Result target:
- Gait remains the default local execution boundary and evidence substrate for agent actions.

---

## Locked Product Decisions (OSS v1.7)

- Keep OSS focused on execution-plane controls and artifacts. No multi-tenant control plane in v1.7.
- Keep runtime posture fail-closed by default; keep `--simulate` as non-enforcing rollout mode.
- Keep policy engine in Go core; do not introduce OPA/Rego dependency in v1.7.
- Keep category boundary stable: Gait is control + proof for agent actions, not an agent orchestrator.
- Keep artifact and schema continuity with v1.x compatibility guarantees.

---

## Current Baseline (Observed in Codebase)

Already implemented:
- Primitive contract and compatibility guard (`docs/contracts/primitive_contract.md`, `scripts/test_contracts.sh`).
- Canonical wrapper + sidecar + MCP proxy boundary (`sdk/python/gait/adapter.py`, `examples/sidecar/gate_sidecar.py`, `cmd/gait/mcp.go`).
- Deterministic incident loop and bootstrap path (`gait regress bootstrap`).
- Local signal engine and schemas (`core/scout/signal.go`, `schemas/v1/scout/*`).
- Wedge integrity CI gate for v1.6 (`scripts/test_v1_6_acceptance.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `v1-6-acceptance`).
- Coverage and perf budget checks in local/CI validation paths.

Gaps to close in v1.7:
- Endpoint primitives are not yet first-class policy taxonomy with explicit constraints (path/domain/destructive classes).
- Skill execution provenance is not yet modeled as supply-chain input with signed/pinned publisher controls.
- Runtime SLO proof is not yet formalized as CI-enforced latency/error-budget contract.
- OSS docs still need an explicit “local-agent safety lane” that maps endpoint + skill controls to operator workflows.
- Required local-agent adapters for `OpenClaw` and `AutoGPT` are not yet implemented with parity checks.

---

## v1.7 Exit Criteria

v1.7 is complete only when all are true:

- Endpoint actions are represented by a stable taxonomy and enforced by Gate deterministically.
- Skill-triggered actions carry provenance and can be verified against signed/pinned allowlist policy.
- Fail-closed behavior and gate overhead are backed by explicit SLO budgets and CI checks.
- A team can adopt endpoint-safe policy and skill provenance checks in one PR using provided templates.
- Required adapter paths for `OpenClaw` and `AutoGPT` pass the same conformance suite as existing adapters.
- OSS remains offline-first, default-safe, vendor-neutral, and independently verifiable.

## Definition of Done (v1.7)

- Endpoint action taxonomy is explicit, stable, and policy-enforced.
- Skill provenance is verifiable (signed/pinned/allowlisted) and auditable.
- Runtime SLO and fail-closed guarantees are measured and CI-enforced.
- OSS adoption path remains one-wrapper/one-sidecar/one-CI-lane and offline-first.
