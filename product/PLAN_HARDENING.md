# PLAN HARDENING: Gait (Zero-Ambiguity Reliability and Resilience Plan)

Date: 2026-02-06
Source of truth: `product/PRD.md`, `product/ROADMAP.md`, `product/PLAN_v1.md`, `product/PLAN_ADOPTION.md`
Scope: minimum required hardening for graceful failure, operational resilience, and architecture guardrails for v1 through v1.5

This plan is written to be executed top-to-bottom with minimal interpretation. Each story includes concrete repo paths, commands, and acceptance criteria.

---

## Global Decisions (Locked for hardening)

- Hardening must preserve core contracts:
  - determinism
  - offline-first defaults
  - stable schemas and exit codes
  - fail-closed behavior for high-risk policy paths
- Hardening is implemented in **Go core and CLI first**; Python remains thin.
- No new hosted dependencies are required for correctness.
- Runtime and operational failures must be machine-classifiable, not only human-readable.
- All persistence paths that influence enforcement or verification must be crash-safe.
- Every hardening change must be covered by deterministic tests across Linux/macOS/Windows.

Priority classes:
- `P0`: must ship before broad production rollout
- `P1`: should ship in next milestone
- `P2`: can follow after P0/P1, but should be planned now

---

## Hardening Objectives

1. Graceful failure under invalid input, missing dependencies, partial writes, lock contention, and network instability.
2. Deterministic recovery behavior and stable error semantics for automation.
3. Operational readiness aligned with:
   - Beyond 12-Factor principles (config, telemetry, ops parity, admin processes)
   - AWS Well-Architected pillars (especially reliability, security, operational excellence)
   - Frugal architecture laws (pay for value, use managed simplicity, optimize for constraints)

---

## Current Baseline (Observed)

- Stable exit code contract already exists in CLI (`cmd/gait/verify.go` constants).
- JSON outputs exist for major commands (`--json`) and are widely tested.
- CI covers lint, unit tests, e2e, and acceptance workflows across OS matrix.
- Pre-push checks exist via `.githooks/pre-push` and pre-commit `pre-push` hooks.
- Key security controls exist:
  - explicit unsafe replay interlocks
  - signature verification
  - allowlist/pin/signature for registry remote install

Known systemic gaps to close:
- runtime/system failures are frequently mapped to `exitInvalidInput` instead of specific operational categories
- critical state/artifact writes are not uniformly atomic
- networked registry flow lacks retry/backoff policy for transient failures
- hook activation is documented but not enforced programmatically
- `product/` planning docs are ignored by `.gitignore` and are not versioned in Git

---
