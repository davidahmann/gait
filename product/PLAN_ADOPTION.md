# PLAN ADOPTION: Gait (Zero-Ambiguity Adoption Execution Plan)

Date: 2026-02-06
Source of truth: `product/PRD.md`, `product/ROADMAP.md`, `product/PLAN_v1.md`, `README.md`
Scope: adoption work for v1 through v1.5 outcomes (developer activation, team rollout, CI embedding, enterprise-ready expansion)

This plan is written for direct execution with minimal interpretation. Every story defines owner-facing tasks, repo paths, run commands, and acceptance criteria.

---

## Global Adoption Decisions (Locked)

- Primary go-to-market motion: **product-led** (self-serve first, sales-assisted second).
- Primary activation wedge: **incident -> deterministic regression** in under 15 minutes.
- First-user path: **one path only**:
  - install
  - `gait demo`
  - `gait verify`
  - `gait regress init --from <run_id>`
  - `gait regress run`
- Runtime boundary rule: adoption guidance always enforces at **tool-call boundary**, never prompt boundary.
- Default rollout mode for new teams: **observe-first**, then **enforce high-risk tools**.
- Artifacts are the trust surface:
  - runpack
  - regress result (+ optional JUnit)
  - gate traces
  - evidence pack
- Product metrics are mandatory for adoption decisions; no roadmap changes without metric evidence.

---

## PLG Operating Principles (Applied to Gait)

These operational principles guide prioritization and sequencing:

1. Fast time-to-value over broad feature count.
2. One clear entry point over many optional paths.
3. Self-serve defaults before enterprise process.
4. Product usage signals drive expansion and sales-assist.
5. Friction removal is a product requirement (not "docs polish").
6. Clear free-to-paid boundary based on governance value.
7. In-product success mechanisms (`doctor`, templates, examples).
8. Measure activation and conversion weekly.
9. Protect trust via deterministic outputs and stable contracts.
10. Keep expansion tied to the execution path, not dashboards.

---

## North-Star Metrics and Definitions (Locked)

### Activation

- `A1`: First successful `gait demo`.
- `A2`: First successful `gait verify` on produced runpack.
- `A3`: First successful `gait regress init`.
- `A4`: First successful `gait regress run`.
- Activation complete: `A1+A2+A3+A4` within 24 hours of install.

### Expansion

- `E1`: Repository has at least 1 gated high-risk tool.
- `E2`: Repository has at least 1 regression fixture in CI.
- `E3`: Team has at least 1 signed gate trace reviewed in incident or change workflow.

### Retention

- `R1`: Weekly active repositories running at least one Gait command.
- `R2`: Weekly regress runs per active repository.
- `R3`: Percent of production tool calls routed through wrapped/gated path.

### Quality and Trust

- `Q1`: Median activation time (`install -> first regress run`) <= 30 minutes.
- `Q2`: Doc-run mismatch rate < 5% (examples that do not work as written).
- `Q3`: Support tickets caused by ambiguous CLI output <= defined threshold.

---

## Adoption Ladder (Target User Journey)

1. First 5 minutes: prove deterministic artifact loop.
2. First day: convert one incident/run into deterministic regression.
3. First week: gate one high-risk tool with approval flow.
4. First month: policy rollout to team repos with CI enforcement.
5. Quarter: enterprise evidence and governance packs in routine use.

## Epic A0: Adoption Data and Instrumentation Foundation

Objective: make adoption measurable without violating offline-first defaults.

### Story A0.1: Define telemetry/event contract (offline-safe)

Tasks:
- Define local event schema for CLI usage and milestone events:
  - `schemas/v1/scout/adoption_event.schema.json` (or adoption schema under `schemas/v1/registry/` if preferred)
- Add Go type mirror:
  - `core/schema/v1/scout/` (or matching package for chosen schema location)
- Include event fields:
  - command name
  - success/failure
  - exit code
  - elapsed_ms
  - milestone tags (`A1`-`A4`, `E1`-`E3`)
  - anonymized environment metadata (OS, version)

Acceptance criteria:
- Schema validates in CI.
- Event records can be written locally without network access.

### Story A0.2: Add opt-in local usage logging

Tasks:
- Add opt-in flag/env for local metrics file:

- Implement write-on-success/failure events in CLI command router:
  - `cmd/gait/main.go`
- Keep default behavior no-op unless opt-in enabled.

Acceptance criteria:
- When enabled, every major command appends a valid event record.
- No behavior change when unset.

### Story A0.3: Add adoption report command

Tasks:
- Add CLI helper:
  - `gait doctor adoption --from <events.jsonl> --json`
- Summarize activation funnel and failure points from local event logs.

Acceptance criteria:
- Command outputs deterministic JSON with activation status and blockers.

## Definition of Done (Adoption Work)

- Every new adoption artifact has:
  - exact commands
  - expected outputs
  - deterministic behavior
- All docs examples are validated in CI or scripted smoke checks.
- No onboarding path requires hidden setup knowledge.
- Integration patterns enforce tool-boundary control and fail-closed behavior.
- Changes improve at least one locked adoption metric (`A*`, `E*`, `R*`, `Q*`).
